# NLP-using-BERT-for-emotion-recognition-learning-rate-optimization-and-adaptive-sampling-strategies
This study explores the categorization of emotions in texts using the BERT-Base Uncased paradigm. It highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning and analyzes the impact of various learning rates on model performance with the Optuna framework. Despite limitations in computational resources, including a small search space and one training period, the study provides valuable insights into how learning rate selection affects performance. The study emphasizes the sensitivity of the model to specific hyperparameters and achieves a best validation accuracy of approximately 0.1667. While these findings may not appear groundbreaking, they contribute fundamental knowledge to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and underscore the significance of a systematic approach to model development, adjustment, and evaluation.The study outlines potential investigation paths, including expanding the hyperparameter search field, increasing the number of training iterations, incorporating additional information, and exploring alternative models. These findings hold significance in text emotion classification with sophisticated models like BERT that are both scientifically grounded and practical.
